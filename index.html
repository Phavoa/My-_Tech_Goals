            <p>
              I aim to specialize in full stack development, mastering both
              frontend and backend technologies. This includes deepening my
              knowledge in languages such as JavaScript, Python, and frameworks
              like React, Angular, Node.js, and Django. I want to be proficient
              in building robust, scalable, and user-friendly web applications.

            <p>
              In addition to full stack development, I intend to acquire the
              necessary skills to excel as a DevOps engineer. This involves
              learning about continuous integration and continuous deployment
              (CI/CD) pipelines, containerization technologies like Docker and
              Kubernetes, and cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google
              Cloud. My goal is to ensure smooth and efficient software delivery
              processes.

              opportunities, and seeking mentorship from experienced colleagues.
